A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## First Step

### I create a Home widget where i display a navBar with two options: Show Cats or show dogs information. On default the app display cats info, you can see which animal is showing because is a red line under the logo.

### This info is taken from the api with dio package. I map this data with a widget call Animals Card, where i display the photo, name and age of the pet. While the call to the api is taken a loading overlay is display to show that the info is loading

### If you want to know more about that specific pet you can click on it and weight and a desc of that pet. I did this with a navegation route.

## Techs I use:
